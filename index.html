        <h2>About Our Project</h2>
        <p>
            This responsive portfolio webpage was created as part of the 
            <strong>Module 02 Mini Hackathon</strong>. 
            Our goal was to build a clean, modern layout using only 
            <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, while applying concepts such as the box model,
            flexbox, grid, and responsive design.
        </p>
        <p>
            The page highlights our teamwork, individual strengths, and the CSS concepts we practiced.
            Each group member was responsible for specific sections and styling areas, 
            which are clearly identified below in the Team Contributions section.
